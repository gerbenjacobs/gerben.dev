                    <p>
                        This course will teach you some basics about Unix, pipes, Go, file descriptors and compilation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm helping a bunch of developers and system engineers at work with learning Go,
                        and when I was given this task I remembered how amazed I was with cross-compiling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To hit the middle of the developer vs system engineer venn diagram, I came up with building
                        a little Go tool that requires piping data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's the first course I created, so I have no feedback yet whether this format works.
                        I'll soon find out.

                        With the investment platform Trading212 you can extract your data as csv,
                        I wanted to use this data for reporting (and aggregation).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project has 2 output methods: yahoo and aggregation. With the Yahoo output you get a new
                        csv
                        file that you can upload to the Yahoo Finance portfolio feature.
                        Aggregation format is a custom JSON format, that incidentally is used for the reporting page,
                        that is included in this project.

                    <p>
                        The reporting page is hosted using GitHub Pages and lives under a subdomain

                    <p>
                        Habbo always had profiles, and they hydrate these with JSON coming from the backend.
                        This library creates types for the common domains (habbo, badge, group, room)
                        and offers an API to deal with the data.

                        If you've had children, you might be aware how much and how heavy diaper waste is.
                        It can easily fill your garbage bins, leaving you with little room left..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The municipality together with the local waste management company had set up
                        dedicated drop off locations, where you could deliver used diapers.

                        It was a list of addresses, but that doesn't help you if you're new to the area
                        or if you prefer visual aids. So I decided to plot these address on a Leaflet map.

                        This was when <strong>open data</strong> was all hyped up and I wanted to build something
                        with it. My municipality of Ede had some data available, of which I picked this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This data contains names, day of birth and birthplace for citizens of Ede
                        between 1812 and 1919 who were eligible to be part of the 'militia'.

                        Honestly, I'm not sure why it's a militia and not just military draft, but I knew
                        I could use datatables to easily search through this giant list of data.

                        Glitch (whimsical MMO made in Flash) + Tweet = Gleetch. Gleetch was an app that allowed you to

                        and have it tweet out your achievements.

                        The app died with the unfortunate demise of Glitch the game itself. The team then made Slack,
