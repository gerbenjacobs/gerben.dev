                    "Cradle To Road" was a h6 PHP project that I made for a competition organized by the
                    <a href="https://rdw.nl">RDW</a> (Dutch Vehicle Authority). I ended up with 3rd place and used the
                    money to buy an iMac.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app allowed you to enter your birthday (or birthdate) and would return the vehicles on the
                    Dutch roads which were registered on the same date and as such would share your birthdate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The older you were, the more difficult it was to find a road legal car that hadn't broken down!

                <p>
                    Glitch (whimsical MMO made in Flash) + Tweet = Gleetch. Gleetch was an app that allowed you to
                    link your <a href="https://www.glitchthegame.com/">Glitch</a> account with your Twitter account
                    and have it tweet out your achievements. See
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahGlitch">example Twitter account</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app died with the unfortunate demise of Glitch the game itself. The team then made Slack,
                    so I guess good on them ;)
