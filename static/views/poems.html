        <h1>Poems</h1>
        <p>
            These poems are mostly from 2004-2007, when I was between 16 and 19 year old.<br>
            I'm not super fond of most of these, they're very angsty emo teen writings, but still I'd like to archive
            them.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a handful that I think still hold up today, more than 20 years later, specifically if you consider
            them as being written by a teenager in his second language.

                    <br>that kept following me, throughout the journey.
                    <br>I've seen valleys and peaks,

                    <br>Cause that's what it is. Life's a giant loop,
                    <br>with only one way out.

                    <br>but the only thing I'm left with are just your lies.
                    <br>I don't think the memories can compete with the situation
                    <br>a place, infinite and personal, is the base
                    <br>that reminds me of the things, our salvation
                    <br>and something singular and impossible to erase.
                    <br>Yet we find no passion, and everything else just restrained
                    <br>and you find some time, cause our talk is scheduled
                    <br>but all my questions stay unexplained
                    <br>and your feelings are still being overruled.
