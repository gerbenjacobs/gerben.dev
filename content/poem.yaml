    <br>The tears under your mask
    <br>reflect the beauty of your outside.
    <br>You'll keep on following
    <br>till your soul has died.
    <br>I'm here to protect you,
    <br>to keep you from falling.
    <br>You don't want to see
    <br>so I'll keep forestalling.
    <br>It won't take him long and you'll say
    <br>all boys are wrong, in their own way.
    <br>Then you'll see what it means
    <br>your sweet fourteens.

    <br>Twenty three days in a box didn't make me think
    <br>how we could change our lives and carry on with it
    <br>Forced thinking, wasn't so forced at all,
    <br>I just needed the time, and the shadows on the wall.
    <br>The results became better, but the process was lethal
    <br>and slowly the words appeared on the paper
    <br>but then we ran out of ink and the relaxation.
    <br>The visions went blurry, the facts started rolling
    <br>I know you want to make decisions, but don't
    <br>cause you're better off thinking forever
    <br>then knowing at this point.
    <br>A whirl pool of thoughts, circulating through your head
    <br>your own problems seem to escape the world of today
    <br>as I sprinkle the words over your hands,
    <br>your cold hands, shivering and stumbling but still trying
    <br>to reach the eternity of the love which you got promised
    <br>but the promises turn in maybe, and maybe is now.
    <br>The tide has changed, but not drastically.
    <br>So I undust my boat, the blue rowboat, I reach out for your hand
    <br>granting you permission to enter, without a line
    <br>As I stroke up my sleeves and look in your eyes, the wind blows
    <br>and we know that's our sign.

    <br>Strangled up in my own words
    <br>fighting my way out, with only a blunt knife.
    <br>I open my small notebook, write down the words
    <br>that kept following me, throughout the journey.
    <br>I've seen valleys and peaks,
    <br>but most time I spent at the bottom
    <br>trying to find an answer, which took me weeks.
    <br>Now I'm at the top, empty handed,
    <br>with only a little bit of experience.
    <br>I've set out a trail, to follow
    <br>when it all starts over again.
    <br>Cause that's what it is. Life's a giant loop,
    <br>with only one way out.
    <br>My signs have been turned, and my path has been changed,
    <br>It's getting harder to breathe, got no oxygen,
    <br>cause you threw it away.
    <br>I know you hate me, I know you despise me,
    <br>that's why I stay alive. I'll never flee.

    <br>The blurry window infront of your eyes
    <br>combined with gray worms of intelligence
    <br>confuses the thoughts of which you live
    <br>into big red questionmarks on my screen.
    <br>Doubting people increase your insecurity
    <br>and the bugs who are on your wings
    <br>make an annoying squeeky sound
    <br>when you fall into the sea.
    <br>And then there I'll be, swimming next to you
    <br>making you the confused one
    <br>when I blow the square bubbles
    <br>of the most hated element.
    <br>Now take away the loneliness
    <br>and hold my shivering hand

    <br>I wish I hadn't seen all the possibilities,
    <br>I wish I wasn't such a dreamer
    <br>I wish the things didn't go like they went
    <br>cause the pain you leave me with is 100 percent.
    <br>Our unfinished deal is faded away by his appearance,
    <br>our friend in black, is waiting in his corner.

    <br>She shrugged and the rest of the gestures flowed free,
    <br>away into the open air, the cold night,
    <br>where stars tenderly kiss and hug,
    <br>and we found reasons to settle for a ceasefire.

    <br>Quite funny how certain things don't work,
    <br>when you're lying naked, drenched in gasoline,
    <br>with the roots of several trees sticking in your back.
    <br>Never thought they could drag me in,
    <br>playing games that shouldn't be played,
    <br>in times when you thought the sun was your best friend.
    <br>Erase the name in your mind with clouds and alcohol,
    <br>reassure yourself that nothing is what it seems,
    <br>eventhough everything is written on your hand.

    <br>The puppets of the world hang silently,
    <br>on their shivering strings,
    <br>when touched by a breeze of wind.
    <br>The only one who can revive them is you,
    <br>sprinkling your fairy dust over their little wooden heads,
    <br>that shine in the soft moonlight.
    <br>Their vessels wind up around your fingers,
    <br>limbs reach out and tangle in the air,
    <br>with one single movement you make them dance.

    <br>Falling backwards into the ocean,
    <br>little fish came to watch upon me,
    <br>as I serenade the silent words,
    <br>chanted into songs of broken hearts.
    <br>I can't get the line off,
    <br>it's haunting me through the night,
    <br>when the day handed the victory,
    <br>to the pale man and his emotionless face.
    <br>Your words about lack of time and peace,
    <br>are holding me down, in the light,
    <br>where I slowly dissolve in,
    <br>those evil beams of our beloved sun.
    <br>Funny how certain miscommunications,
    <br>are so painfully elaborated,
    <br>that we can not laugh with our face,
    <br>but through the cracks in our hearts.
    <br>Supposedly this is what you get,
    <br>when your heart attacks,
    <br>no combustion in the chamber,
    <br>a mere illuminating shine of fear from my eyes.
    <br>So here's a telegram with a bullet,
    <br>for the intake, gaping hole, seemingly,
    <br>big enough for the two of us,
    <br>only if you hadn't locked it.

    <br>If putting flowers in my hair could be an approved spare time thing,
    <br>then I'd be withheld by the things that never could stop you.
    <br>Somewhere, I still think, that there could have been so much more,
    <br>than a row of excuses for the fake persons that we hold inside.
    <br>You have no idea how much I long for windy days to airborne my kite,
    <br>so I can steer it along the waves of the sky and sail it into the night.
    <br>Summertime cliches never were enough for you, you needed so much more,
    <br>and I'm hopping along, jumping from one of your thoughts to another, in ecstasy.

    <br>Somewhere between the trees and the fog,
    <br>the wet illuminating moss,
    <br>I can only focus on the rotten deceased log,
    <br>to be honest, my entire life is built around your loss.
    <br>As I walk on, further into the woods,
    <br>my footsteps sink into the mud,
    <br>every step I make, changes your mood,
    <br>the missiles you fire are all duds.
    <br>Can't you see I'm struggling with myself,
    <br>I'm more scared than I ever been,
    <br>love's not the same as it was when we were twelve,
    <br>but it's your life and I picture myself somewhere in between.

    <br>Een zilveren pijl, sierlijk en vakbekwaam herrozen,
    <br>vanuit een donkere warme broedplaats,
    <br>voor elegantie en gratie, als het had gekozen,
    <br>scheidt het letterlijk en figuurlijk, willekeurig melaats.
    <br>Onderworpen aan de wetten der natuur, vervolgt het zijn weg,
    <br>waar het kan gaan, tot een samenloop van omstandigheden,
    <br>en ophoping van mathematische formules, of een simpele heg,
    <br>de voortgang onderbreken en het tot z'n recht brengen, het verleden.

    <br>Dear world,
    <br>what's up with this progression,
    <br>you unwanted piece of fuçk,
    <br>break or die, I'll never kiss the sky.
    <br>
    <br>Make thy God bow and give room for the chosen ones,
    <br>whisper in silence, cry at night,
    <br>Frighten are the lambs,
    <br>that will never find shelter at your side.
    <br>
    <br>Play this violin one more time,
    <br>for this shepherd shall lose one sheep,
    <br>and while it will get stabbed in the back,
    <br>it will always be a win-win situation.
    <br>
    <br>Bitch.

    <br>Het begint al vroeg,
    <br>zo rond je achtste levensjaar,
    <br>sta je daar dan op het schoolplein.
    <br>
    <br>Je wordt ouder, het plein ook,
    <br>op naar het volgende plein,
    <br>museumplein, kauwgum, sigaretten en alcohol.
    <br>
    <br>Daar sta je weer,
    <br>het oude vertrouwde plein,
    <br>samen met je mede-senioren, kleinkinderen en kaartspellen.
    <br>
    <br>Het plein staat voor iets centraals,
    <br>zoals jij in het midden van je leven staat,
    <br>kinderkopjes, baarmoederschopjes, bruine beren dropjes.
