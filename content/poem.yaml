      <br>The tears under your mask
      <br>reflect the beauty of your outside.
      <br>You'll keep on following
      <br>till your soul has died.
      <br>I'm here to protect you,
      <br>to keep you from falling.
      <br>You don't want to see
      <br>so I'll keep forestalling.
      <br>It won't take him long and you'll say
      <br>all boys are wrong, in their own way.
      <br>Then you'll see what it means
      <br>your sweet fourteens.

      <br>Twenty three days in a box didn't make me think
      <br>how we could change our lives and carry on with it
      <br>Forced thinking, wasn't so forced at all,
      <br>I just needed the time, and the shadows on the wall.
      <br>The results became better, but the process was lethal
      <br>and slowly the words appeared on the paper
      <br>but then we ran out of ink and the relaxation.
      <br>The visions went blurry, the facts started rolling
      <br>I know you want to make decisions, but don't
      <br>cause you're better off thinking forever
      <br>then knowing at this point.
      <br>A whirl pool of thoughts, circulating through your head
      <br>your own problems seem to escape the world of today
      <br>as I sprinkle the words over your hands,
      <br>your cold hands, shivering and stumbling but still trying
      <br>to reach the eternity of the love which you got promised
      <br>but the promises turn in maybe, and maybe is now.
      <br>The tide has changed, but not drastically.
      <br>So I undust my boat, the blue rowboat, I reach out for your hand
      <br>granting you permission to enter, without a line
      <br>As I stroke up my sleeves and look in your eyes, the wind blows
      <br>and we know that's our sign.

      <br>Strangled up in my own words
      <br>fighting my way out, with only a blunt knife.
      <br>I open my small notebook, write down the words
      <br>that kept following me, throughout the journey.
      <br>I've seen valleys and peaks,
      <br>but most time I spent at the bottom
      <br>trying to find an answer, which took me weeks.
      <br>Now I'm at the top, empty handed,
      <br>with only a little bit of experience.
      <br>I've set out a trail, to follow
      <br>when it all starts over again.
      <br>Cause that's what it is. Life's a giant loop,
      <br>with only one way out.
      <br>My signs have been turned, and my path has been changed,
      <br>It's getting harder to breathe, got no oxygen,
      <br>cause you threw it away.
      <br>I know you hate me, I know you despise me,
      <br>that's why I stay alive. I'll never flee.

      <br>The blurry window infront of your eyes
      <br>combined with gray worms of intelligence
      <br>confuses the thoughts of which you live
      <br>into big red questionmarks on my screen.
      <br>Doubting people increase your insecurity
      <br>and the bugs who are on your wings
      <br>make an annoying squeeky sound
      <br>when you fall into the sea.
      <br>And then there I'll be, swimming next to you
      <br>making you the confused one
      <br>when I blow the square bubbles
      <br>of the most hated element.
      <br>Now take away the loneliness
      <br>and hold my shivering hand
      <br>then I'll let you feel the vibes
      <br>I'm sure it is the way you meant.

    <br>All the hope you gave me,
    <br>all the things I gave you.
    <br>They weren't enough, for you to see
    <br>that you meant so much to me.
    <br>I wish I hadn't seen all the possibilities,
    <br>I wish I wasn't such a dreamer
    <br>I wish the things didn't go like they went
    <br>cause the pain you leave me with is 100 percent.
    <br>Our unfinished deal is faded away by his appearance,
    <br>our friend in black, is waiting in his corner.
    <br>I know it's too late, and so do you.
    <br>And if you don't, it will come through.

    <br>Nooit zal men het weten,
    <br>dat jij en ik meer wisten,
    <br>dan zij ooit hadden kunnen denken.
    <br>Maar toch kwamen we er nooit uit.
    <br>Een paar dingen bleven het zelfde,
    <br>maar de meerderheid koos,
    <br>voor wat voor ons onbereikbaar bleek,
    <br>toch de andere kant.
    <br>Alle dagen waren verloren gegaan,
    <br>aan zij die niet dachten,
    <br>maar jij en ik,
    <br>wij weten wel beter..
