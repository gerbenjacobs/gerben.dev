    "markdown": "\"Hell On Earth\" is one of those YouTube channels, where when you find them the first time, you're spending a lot of days (weeks?) to watch back older videos. Helps that they have a giant backlog.\r\n\r\nIt's a channel with 3 lads who do 'weird camping' (actual name of their show), 'urbex' (they hate this word, but it's what they do) and other assorted tomfoolery. A great mix of 'lads woohoo' and 'wearing nail paint and chastising people for littering'.\r\n\r\nCheck 'em out: https://www.youtube.com/@upthehoe",
