Maybe it's more like 'old Twitter', but I reckon that's only because of how new it is and major non-human entities haven't moved in yet.\r\n\r\nI must emphasise that I haven't fully engaged with Bluesky yet, I still have the _tutorial_ to add more than 7 people. But I'm already getting an algorithmic timeline with \"hot posts\". Can't deny I don't mind a shitpost from time to time, but I just can't get over the fact that people are expertly crafting the right words to increase boostability.\r\n\r\nSo the latest drama is about moderation, either because toxic people are not getting moderated or because it's easy to impersonate someone. These are gonna be difficult problems for BlueSky to solve. I feel like this also ties into the 'popularity contest', because nobody in the fediverse is going to complain about \"not getting my username\", because there's no concept like that. _Famous_ people just have names like \"barny@hachyderm.io\" or \"xdesix@toot.lol\" (these are fictional accounts, I hope, I haven't checked). Bottomline; it's not merely a technical problem to solve, it's mostly human.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do hope they succeed in a sense and that they keep working on the distributed nature (even though they really aren't). Maybe if bluesky.social fails itself, the AT Protocol can survive and other instances like BlackSky can still flourish.\r\n\r\nOn one hand I'm happy that bluesky.social is taking the brunt of X/Twitter refugees, on the other hand I wish people would choose the fediverse..",
