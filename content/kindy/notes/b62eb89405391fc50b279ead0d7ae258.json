Do you never order something online? How are you willing to walk 1 hour into a forest, into actual hike territory time, only to pollute the same nature you're trying to enjoy?\r\n\r\nI'm noticing these occurrences way too much to pin it on a handful of sociopaths.. there's just actual people who live like this.",
