But it's just a crutch to help me accept vulnerability. 🥲\r\n\r\nThe poems were written between 2004 and 2007, and honestly, I'm not sure why I stopped. I know what initiated it, which.. requires a post for another time. \r\n\r\nSo let's hope the page will eventually grow, and if not, at least it's a nice archive.\r\n\r\nhttps://gerben.dev/poems 📜✍🏻",
