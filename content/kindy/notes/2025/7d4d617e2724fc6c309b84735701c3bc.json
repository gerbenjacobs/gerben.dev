    "markdown": "There's this video of a #Tesla #robot, which is being operated by a human, but the operator severs the connection while the robot is still running, causing it to disconnect and fall over.\r\n\r\nThe thing that's actually freaking me out is that there's no dead-man-switch, why does the bot not disengage all motors, how is it allowed to fall over? Also you can see as its arm comes down, it crushes a water bottle, water spraying everywhere. I feel like a water bottle has as much tensile strength as a little kid's hand or arm..\r\n\r\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/jjvincent.bsky.social/post/3m7hps4h2x22r\r\n",
