Short list candidates are 11ty and Hugo, 11ty straight up says you need to install Node/NPM and Hugo has you download binaries (which is only half the batttle).\r\n\r\nAfter some thought, I think the best solution is to have people install Go (comes with a nice Windows MSI installer) and then have people use `go install github.com/gohugoio/hugo@latest`. The installation of Go and the bin directories will take care of all of the $PATH issues.\r\n\r\nI'm also assuming most MacOS users will be more familiar with installing binaries or at least have some kind of package manager like `brew`.",
