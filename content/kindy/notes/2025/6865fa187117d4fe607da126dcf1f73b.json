  "title": "Game Design: Scanner Levels and Asteroid Generation",
  "content": "\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-php\"\u003e$density = [[10, 80], [20, 90], [30, 100]];\r\n$size = [[50, 150], [100, 200], [150, 200]];\r\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nThese arrays of tuples (pairs) represent the density and size of asteroids in a game I'm developing. Where each set is represented by a level i.e. level 1 density has the range \u003ccode\u003e10\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e80\u003c/code\u003e. Density determines how much energy it costs to mine and size just represents how much material you can get from it. Based on your \"Scanner Level\" you get an auto-generated asteroid.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nOut of context that may seem fine; of course a better scanner will give you better asteroids to mine. But if you think about it longer (and with context), players who can afford a better scanner, probably also have access to factories that can mine or have more money from playing longer, and can just buy minerals from the market instead of mining asteroids.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nSo now the game design question is; should a Level 1 Scanner give you fractionally better asteroids then Level 2 and 3? Will that force higher level players to retreive minerals from other sources? Is that what I want as the game designer? Should I maybe only apply this to Density but keep the old system for Size?\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nThere's quite a disconnect between the theoretical \"better scanner, better results\" and the practical \"the player who relies on asteroid mining, is worse off when they need it the most\".\r\n\u003c/p\u003e",
