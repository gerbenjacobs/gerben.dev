Even some people who, because of when they were born, missed the beginning and look at it as some kind of distant history.\r\n\r\nBut it was not 'history' to me.. I literally lived it.. And, so I get it now.. when people say \"Oh man Woodstock 69.. you had to be there\".\r\n\r\nIt's making me feel old and cool at the same time..",
