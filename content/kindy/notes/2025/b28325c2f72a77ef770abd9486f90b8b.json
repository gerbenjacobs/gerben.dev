(Any kind of jam.)\r\n\u003e - I made a thing and I’m proud!\r\n\u003e - I’m bad at it a thing, but I’m sharing anyway!\r\n\u003e - This is my important animal or person. \r\n\u003e - Whimsical shitpost.\r\n\u003e - Real life mundane thing.\r\n\r\nQT: https://wandering.shop/@troublewithwords/110177553537359881\r\n\r\nYes, to this. It's probably uncool to still compare the [#fediverse](https://gerben.dev/tags/fediverse) to bluesky, but I feel like this is what irks me the most.\r\n\r\nI hope they never introduce an algorithm here.",
