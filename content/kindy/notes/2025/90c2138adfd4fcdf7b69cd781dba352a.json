My mind is still occupied with [discovering my old site](https://gerben.dev/notes/b556ca7cf2ba35cdc2d73977b7d1bd6b) and there's so many cool things there, that I somehow forgot.\r\n\r\n- I had a section called \"Domain\", which was a history of the site. Today that would probably be called \"Colophon\"\r\n- I had a section called \"Fan\" which would list image buttons of things I liked, apparently back then 100x31 was the norm, instead of [88x31](https://indieweb.org/88x31)\r\n- I had a \"Playlist\" page, because _back in my day_ you had to arrange your music manually..\r\n- There was \"Hostees\", which I had noooo idea what it was till I opened the page.. Apparently I was 'hosting' some of my friend's sites as subdomains on my site.\r\n- And there's \"Exits\", which were apparently links to resources, cool websites etc.\r\n\r\nThe entire thing was a bunch of `\u003ctable\u003e`'s and inline HTML (+ some CSS), but it worked, and even now in a version where the remote CSS file and images don't work in [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org), it still looks very palatable..\r\n\r\nSo the 'dilemma' is that I changed so many layouts (which was fun), everything was so simple, I barely used paragraphs (apparently) and my content table was `480px` and in the middle of the page with a `\u003ccenter\u003e`. Now, on _gerben.dev_, I wouldn't dare to do all that.. everything has to be **perfect**.. and now I'm thinking whether that is ruining the fun.. I'm trying to rewrite my layout in a different branch, but it's so much work. 🫠\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/kd/images/notes/2025/screenshot_2004_website.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of my website showing a menu: My Blog + Domain + About me + Fan + Music + Playlist + Poems + Quotes + You + Starlog Service + Hostees + Exits.
