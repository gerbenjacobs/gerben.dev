<p>
    I've changed the visibililty of Project Millwheat to "public", but also archived it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Project Millwheat</b> was an idea I had since forever, mostly inspired by games such as <a href="https://travian.com" target="_blank">Travian</a> 
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Merchants:_The_Shattered_Kingdom" target="_blank">Knights And Merchants</a>.
</p>
<p>
    With my love for <a href="/tags/Medieval" class="p-category">#Medieval</a> things, the idea of a game that has you handle the production chain
    of medieval products such as baking bread, was something I wanted to crate. Build a farm producing wheat, a mill processing it into flour, 
    and a bakery to bake the bread.

</p>
<p>
    Hence the name "Millwheat". I'm not sure what I would have called the final game.

    You can also read my initial post on the PBBG-reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PBBG/comments/ht26dg/project_millwheat/" target="_blank">Project Millwheat</a>
    and a follow-up post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PBBG/comments/v72nbr/prealpha_of_millwheat/" target="_blank">Pre-Alpha of Millwheat</a>.
</p>

<p>
    These posts explain a bit more about the idea and what I was going for.
    <br>There's also the <a href="https://github.com/gerbenjacobs/millwheat/blob/main/GAMEDESIGN.md" target="_blank">GAMEDESIGN.md</a> file,
    but it's written in what I like to call <i>"developer notes"</i>.
</p>

<h2>Open sourcing</h2>
<p>
    This project was private for a long time and I haven't touched it in years. But because of Dependabot I was still looking at it every now and then.
    I decided to open source it, so that anyone can take a look at it.
</p>
<p>
    The project itself is abandoned, and as such I have archived it, but for <i>learning purposes</i> it's available now.
    You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/gerbenjacobs/millwheat">https://github.com/gerbenjacobs/millwheat</a>.
</p>

<h2>Designing a game</h2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerbenjacobs/millwheat/refs/heads/main/resources/images/buildings/mill.png" alt="Mill" style="float: right;">
<p>
    This was a clear example of good ideas not being enough to make a good game. There were so many design decisions that still
    had to be made, for it even to be a playable game.
</p>
<p>
    The original idea was that everything takes an hour and that this would be a <abbr title="Persistent Browser Based Game">PBBG</abbr>
    that you check in on, every so often during the day. I had great plans of adding battles and fluid map control, but I never got that far.
</p>
<p>
    The project was also written in Go and I was relatively new to specificially web development in Go. And truth be told, it's not
    the best language for this.
</p>
<p>
    So when I figured that even for me playing it, the hours of waiting would not be enticing enough, development fizzled out.
</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>
    I'm secretly still working on my <a href="/tags/SpaceGame" target="_blank">Spacegame project</a>,
    but between work and family, that's of course going slow. (Although I've done a lot of work since I posted that note.)
</p>
<p>
    Besides that, the original "wheat, flour, bread" idea is still living rent free in my head and I could
    see myself making a Travian-like game. If you want that itch scratched there's <a href="http://europe1300.eu/" target="_blank">Europe 1300 (not HTTPS)</a>
    and <a href="https://www.thegraillords.net" target="_blank">The Grail Lords</a>, some PBBGs that are still running and have a similar concept.
</p>
<p>
    The other Thing™ that I also might wanna do, is update my <a href="https://transportgame.eu" target="_blank">Transport Game Europe</a>
    project to use a more modern tech stack. It's kinda stuck on Laravel 5.7 and PHP 7.4.
