    "Looking back" <b>because</b> this happened in 2017. I was going through my <a href="/photos">photos</a>
    and found <a href="https://gerben.dev/photos/a0b46fa3475277190600e0b73c5f78f6">only 1 picture</a> from that trip.
    To be fair, most of the photos aren't super great for &ndash; at the time &ndash; Instagram.
    But for my blog, I think they are perfect.

    This entire trip was actually a company retreat for my previous job at <a href="https://www.bol.com">bol.com</a>.
    <br>It was a couple of days, one day full of team-based games and eventually relaxing at the pool.
    The other day you could sign up for a guided tour in the capital of <a href="/tags/Palermo">Palermo</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We were flying with 5 different planes from 3 different airports, with the goal to reach Palermo Airport around
    the same time. But one of the planes had to divert to an airport on the east coast, because of volcanic
    activity from Etna. They were shuttled over by bus and arrived later.
    <br>The other thing that I'm remembering now based on the photos, is that in 2017 Europe was still
    in heightened terrorist alert and a lot of security was a normal scene.

    The team-based games were okay, full respect for whoever organized it, but those games are always so cringey.
    <br>Most of my team decided in the early afternoon, that the pool was a better place to be.

    I'm very glad I signed up for the tour. Most of the people I knew didn't want to go, but stayed for the pool.
    So I had to overcome my anxiety and go 'alone' <small>(with colleagues I don't know)</small>
</p>

<p>
    It was a guided tour through the city, with a local guide. That means you get to enjoy the architecture, but
    also learn the history and all kinds of tiny tidbits of trivia. Very interesting.
