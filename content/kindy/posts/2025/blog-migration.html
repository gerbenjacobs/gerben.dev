    I've completed my <a href="/tags/BlogMigration">#BlogMigration</a> project.
</p>
<p>
    I've copied all my posts from <a href="https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl">blog.gerbenjacobs.nl</a> to here.
    The idea is that this will be my forever-home, and blog.gerbenjacobs.nl will become a Dutch blog. (If I have the energy).
</p>
<p>
    I still have to set up the redirects, but that will be a task for another day.
</p>
<p>
    One of the last post I wrote there was <a href="https://gerben.dev/posts/thoughts-on-indieweb">Thoughts on Indieweb</a>,
    were I was debating what I want to do.. So I guess in a sense, this is a follow-up to that post.
</p>
<p>
    I'll add a special tag to all those posts; #BlogMigration, so you (or I) can easily find them.
