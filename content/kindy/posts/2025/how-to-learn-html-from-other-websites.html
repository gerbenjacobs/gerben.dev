    I wanted this post to be for beginners, and not have the title sound too overwhelming. But...

<p>
    I stumbled upon the wonderful website of <a href="https://localghost.dev">Sophie Koonin</a> (<b>localghost.dev</b>) and noticed a nice pixelart
    header, along with the resources she used to create it. It was a <abbr title="A collection of many images, squished into one image, so certain software tools 
    can deal with it as seperate entities, but still only load 1 image file.">spritesheet</abbr> and I wondered how she
    turned that into a header (and whether it automatically scales).
</p>
<p>
    My initial thought was to check the source code, but I couldn't find it quick enough, so I went for my trusty Element Selector.
</p>

<h2>How to view the source</h2>

<p>
    Every website is made up of HTML (and often more), which is available to view in your browser.
    Some sites prevent you from right-clicking <small>(please don't, there's no point)</small>, but you can <code>right-click</code>
    and then select <code>View Page Source</code> or similar wording.
</p>

<p>
    You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +<kbd>U</kbd> on Mac) to view
    the page source.
    <br><small>(This also bypasses any right-click restrictions)</small>
</p>

<p>
    Viewing source was relativelly easy in the old days, but nowadays websites are more complex, sometimes generated by
    JavaScript, and often minified (all spaces and linebreaks removed) or just very disorderly.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, I could not spot <b>localghost</b>'s header and so I used the element selector in Developer Tools to find
    it.
</p>


<h2>Element selector</h2>

<p>
    To open Developer Tools, you can <code>right-click</code> on the element you want to inspect, and select
    <code>Inspect</code> or similar wording.
    <br>Alternatively, you can open Developer Tools with <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
    <kbd>I</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Mac).
</p>

<p>
    It's often the first tab that has the Element Inspector. In Chrome it's called "Elements"
    (or similar in other languages, my screenshots are in Dutch f.e.), while in Firefox it's called "Inspector".
    <br>You're gonna want to find something similar that then has a bunch of HTML visible.
</p>

<p>
    You can use this window (which is different from View Source, as it has collapsible elements and highlights the
    selected
    element) to inspect the HTML of the page. <b>But..</b>
</p>

<p>
    The best feature, and the one I'm using to figure out how this pixelart header is made, is the &hellip; actually, I'm not
    sure if it has a name. It's the button that looks like a screen with a mouse in it. An "element selector".
</p>

        alt="The button to inspect elements">
</figure>

<p>
    Once this button is activated, you can hover over elements on the page, and click them to inspect them in the
    Developer Tools window. It will automatically jump to the relevant HTML code.
</p>

        <img src="/kd/images/blog/2025/source_localghost_3.png" class="u-photo hoverable"
            alt="Inspector has pointed me to some CSS in the header element">
    </a>
</figure>

<p>
    It points me to <code>::after</code> within a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element. This is a CSS pseudo-element, which
    you can use to add content to an element without adding it to the HTML.
    <small>(This also explains why I couldn't find it in the HTML with View Source)</small>
</p>

<p>
    The code for it is on the right, and turns out it's a background image (966x64 pixels) with the CSS attribute <code>repeat-x</code>
    to repeat it horizontally.
</p>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>
    Just a quick note on ethics: Inspecting source code and elements is perfectly fine, and is how many people
    learn web development. However, copying someone's work without permission is not okay.
    <br>If you want to use someone's images, designs, or code, always ask for permission and give proper credit.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, Sophie is <a href="https://localghost.dev/about/">explicitly mentioning</a> that her site is open source,
    and you're allowed to <i>steal</i> and learn from her code. She's written nicely about her webdvelopment journey
    and it sounded very similar to mine.
