        Eating your own dog food or "dogfooding" is the practice of using one's own products or services.

    This is a known idiom within the software world, and the idea is
    that by using your own products, you'll get a better feel for
    what customers will experience. Potentially even fixing things
    before it becomes an actual bug.
</p>

<h2>What is raccoonfooding?</h2>

<p>
    Instead of using your own products and services, you intend
    to use your friends creations.
</p>
<p>
    Where friends is a broad term, but basically means that you
    use <a href="https://gerben.dev/posts/artisanal-software-for-humans">software made by people</a>
    instead of big corporations. They can be your actual friends, they can be your
    <a href="/tags/indieweb">#IndieWeb</a> friends or your favourite queer tech kitten collective.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Why raccoon?</b> Well, have you ever seen those videos where they
    come onto peoples porches and eat cat food from bowls, while the cats
    stand around in bewilderment. That's why.
</p>

<h2>Why raccoonfooding?</h2>

<p>
    In essence still for the same reasons, but where you help your friends
    by discovering things; user experience, bugs, unexpected behaviour.
</p>

<p>
    But it's also very nice if you're on the other side, and people use your
    software that you've worked hard on. It's a bit of spreading appreciation. ✨
</p>

<p>
    Are there downsides? Yes, potentially. There's more than likely not a big team behind it,
    it might not always be up, and it takes a lot of effort to keep offering something,
    so one day they might announce the end of the project.
</p>

<p>
    But this is the charm of raccoonfooding, and means you can find another friend who might offer
    something similar.
</p>

<h2>The things I'm raccoonfooding right now</h2>

<p>
    I recently started using 🍡 <a href="https://mochi.meadow.cafe">Mochi</a> by
    <a href="https://meadow.cafe">Meadow Cafe</a>,
    a simple privacy-friendly analytics tool. It's right now running next to my Google Analytics,
    but nobody in my spheres is a big fan of that, and for good reasons.
</p>

<p>
    But the reason for this entire concept, came when I looked at their
    💌 <a href="https://guestbooks.meadow.cafe">Guestbooks</a> offering.
    If you're a developer, like me, one of the relatively easiest and earliest things
    you make, in many tutorials alike, is a guestbook system.
</p>

<p>
    That's when the idea arose that instead of making that myself, I should just use
    theirs. Dogfooding in a sense, but different.. raccoonfooding.
</p>

<p>
    When thinking about this blogpost, I also realized that I was already using
    something. My webmentions are by <a href="https://webmention.io">webmention.io</a>
    a project by <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>, one of the <i>founding fathers</i>
    of the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Next on the choppin' block is something with <a href="https://xmit.co">xmit.co</a>
    by <a href="https://pcarrier.com/">Pierre Carrier</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I'm not sure yet what, because it's static hosting and it will live on a separate domain,
    but it can be some kind of "art installation" or side-project.
