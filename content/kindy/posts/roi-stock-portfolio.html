<p>After reading a bit about multiple well-known investors mentioning how important Return On Invested Capital is,
    I decided to generate a small portfolio (actually a pie within <a
        href="https://www.trading212.com/invite/HrAs2dFZ">Trading212</a>) with some metrics.</p>
<p>I used <a
        href="https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_midover,fa_div_pos,fa_netmargin_o25,fa_roi_verypos,sh_avgvol_o1000&amp;ft=4">finviz</a>
    to screen and since they don't have ROIC, I used Return On Investment (ROI).
    This is a different metric but is the closest option there is. My screening options were as follows:</p>
<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>ROI of 25% or higher</li>
    <li>Net profit margin of 25% or higher</li>
    <li>Market cap of 2 billion or higher</li>
    <li>Positive dividend</li>
    <li>Average trading volume of 1 million</li>
</ul>
<p>So the important values are the ROI and net profit margins. However to give me some more established companies
    I also made sure that they have a market cap of 2 billion or more, enough trading volume and a positive dividend.
    This last option as a soft guarantee that the company is free cash flow positive.</p>
<p>I started this endeavor on <strong>August 10th</strong> and plan to add <strong>€100</strong> every month for 10
    months,
    then keep it there for a month and finally after <strong>12 months</strong> sell it all. This would be August 10th,
    2023.
    The idea is slightly inspired by <em>The Magic Formula</em>, except that I won't prune the portfolio, with the
    biggest caveat
    being that a company might fall below my requirements down the road.</p>
<p>I'm aware that a year is not enough to make any statements about the ROI of the portfolio.
    But I'm considering all of this just a fun challenge, while I keep working on my other growth and dividend
    portfolio.</p>

<p>If you use my <a
        href="https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_midover,fa_div_pos,fa_netmargin_o25,fa_roi_verypos,sh_avgvol_o1000&amp;ft=4">finviz</a>
    link, you can see quite a few companies. I went through it manually and added the ones I liked and didn't own;
    I ended up with 17 companies.</p>
<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>Microsoft (MSFT) - 7.5%</li>
    <li>Apple (AAPL) - 7.5%</li>
    <li>Mastercard (M) - 7%</li>
    <li>Qualcomm (QCOM) - 7%</li>
    <li>McDonald's (MCD) - 7%</li>
    <li>S&amp;P Global (SPGI) - 7%</li>
    <li>Novo Nordisk (NVO) - 7%</li>
    <li>Southern Copper (SCCO) - 7%</li>
    <li>Blackstone Inc (BX) - 7%</li>
    <li>Paychex (PAYX) - 7%</li>
    <li>Lousiana Pacific (LPX) - 7%</li>
    <li>Rio Tinto (RIO) - 3.7%</li>
    <li>Vale (VALE) - 3.7%</li>
    <li>Applied Materials (AMAT) - 3.7%</li>
    <li>KLA Corporation (KLAC) - 3.7%</li>
    <li>Vermillion Energy (VRX) - 3.6%</li>
    <li>Crescent Point Energy (CRP) - 3.6%</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of companies were quite similar, so I <em>combined</em> their allocations at three and a half percent; a
    miner, a semiconductor and an energy (gas) company.
    Although you can also argue that Qualcomm and Southern Copper should have been together then. To make the pie 100% I
    then added a bit more to MSFT and AAPL.</p>
<h2 id="one-month-later">One month later</h2>
<p>Now that we're a month in, here are the current results.</p>

    <li>Crescent Point Energy (CPG) - ✔️(0.55%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The portfolio was up quite nicely for a week before the market started to drop.
    I'm posting this a week after the 10th and since then we've had 2 days of heavy losses as well.</p>
<p>However, this is fine, means that I can buy more shares at a lower price when it's October.</p>
