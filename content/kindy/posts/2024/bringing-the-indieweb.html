<p>
    As part of my move towards the indieweb, I've been creating a system on
    <a href="https://gerben.dev">gerben.dev</a> to create notes, posts, likes etc.
</p>
<p>
    This started out as a new project, but for now I'm just creating it internally.
</p>

<h2>Kindy</h2>

<p>
    I've named the system Kindy, because I'm making different <b>kind</b> of content.
    <em>I also discovered that Australia and New Zealand use this word to mean <b>kindergarten</b>.</em>
</p>

<p>
    My Kindy however, is a JSON format for which I've created a Go <code>template/html</code> that
    turns those fields into HTML with <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">Microformats's h-entry</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Which works nicely for likes and notes, but for posts, which ideally includes quite a bit of HTML
    it was actually quite difficult. Can't have multiline support in <code>JSON</code>.<br>
    So I switched to <code>YAML</code> and while that worked, I was not getting formatting help.
    So time for, yet, another solution.
</p>

<p>
    I now put a filename in my <code>content</code> field and when I detect this (hardcoded to <code>.html</code>
    for now) I load that file and replace the content.
</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>
    The reason I stopped with making this an open source project, is that I early on noticed how many
    decisions need to be made in regard to mark up, styling and overall design of the product.
</p>

<p>
    When I talked with my wife about this, she mentioned that it <b>is</b> a lot of work and probably only
    developers can deal with it, defeating the purpose of the project.
</p>

<p>
    The thing about customization is that if you want to implement this properly, your product
    will have a lot of configuration. For which you need a lot of code and even more documentation.
</p>

<p>
    But this means <i>regular users</i> always have to have some sort of compromise on how their
    website looks, unless they themselves become tech-savvy enough to basically create their own.
    <br>
    Which brings us back to <a class="p-category" href="/tags/indieweb">indieweb</a>: everyone should have
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">their own website</a>.
</p>

<h2>Bridging and syndication</h2>

<p>
    Meanwhile, I've been actively trying to get <a href="https://fed.brid.gy">fed.brid.gy</a> to work,
    and while it does work for webmentions and Fediverse bridging, I'm having a lot of trouble
    with getting the Bluesky stuff to work.
</p>

<p>
    Then I read <a href="https://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith's</a> blog and notice how he's doing the
    syndication himself, by use of some simple PHP scripts. So should I start doing it myself too?
</p>

<p>
    Being a programmer actually makes it way more difficult with all these existing indieweb solutions,
    because you technically can learn how to do it... <i>and then roll your own</i>, a programmer's favourite pastime.
</p>

<p>
    Anyway, I should probably continue with finishing my content management system and see what kind
    of data it creates. Syndicating can come later...

    <i>
        P.s. What should I do with permalinks? For now, I got <code>/posts/{YYYYMMDD}-{slug}</code>,
        but I also would like to just have the slug. But can I trust myself to always come up with unique titles?
