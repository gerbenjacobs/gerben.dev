<p>
    Spent our Sunday at Meinerswijk, a swampy area in the "uiterwaarden" of Arnhem.
    <br>Uiterwaarden are the floodplains of a river, in this case the Rhine.
</p>
<p>
    In the 20th century the landscape was ever changing, a lot of clay and sand was dug up
    and more and more of the area was turned into a watery paradise for wildlife.
    In 1995 the council of Arnhem decided to turn the area into a nature reserve.
</p>
<p>
    If we go more into the past, we see a couple of Sherman tank cupolas entombed in concrete.
    This was done in the Cold War with leftover tanks from the Second World War.
    These emplacements were part of a larger "IJsellinie" defense line, however it never got fully completed.
</p>
<p>
    But this defense line goes even further back in time. On this location the Romans built a fortification,
    a so called "castellum". This was part of the Limes, the border of the Roman Empire.
    <br>This castellum was re-built 3 times, the last time in the 4th century.
    Its goal: to guard the river and protect against the Batavians.
