    I have been writing Go (or Golang) for about 6 years now. In that time I've seen quite a few different ways
    on how to organize a Go project. During my time at <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a> I got
    introduced to a nice layered approach.
    I've taken those lessons and applied them to something that feels right for me; <a
        href="https://github.com/gerbenjacobs/svc">github.com/gerbenjacobs/svc</a>

<h2 id="svc">svc</h2>
<p>svc is not an actual framework, but more a convention for creating microservices.</p>
<p>The core of svc is centered around 3 layers: <b>handlers</b>, <b>services</b> and
    <b>storages</b>.
    Together with the <code>cmd</code> folder they are responsible for organizing your code into a clean and
    well-organized structure.
</p>
<p>The idea is that requests only flow down the stack and answers flow up. These layers are connected via <b>domain
        models</b>.</p>
<p>Communication between the layers is done via interfaces. These are located in the file with the same name as the
    layer.
    So in order to learn more about what kind of storages we have, for example, you can visit
    <code>/storages/storage.go</code>.

<h3 id="handlers">Handlers</h3>
<p>Handler is a struct that acts as a dependency injection container.
    They are the entry point for your application, everything is delegated from there.</p>
<p>They translate your requests into domain models and delegate the actual work to services, and vice versa.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// Handler is your dependency container
type Handler struct {
    mux http.Handler
    Dependencies
}

// Dependencies contains all the dependencies your application and its services require
type Dependencies struct {
    UserSvc    services.UserService
    WebhookSvc services.WebhookService
    Auth       *services.Auth
}

// New creates a new handler given a set of dependencies
func New(dependencies Dependencies) *Handler {
    h := &amp;Handler{
        Dependencies: dependencies,
    }
    
    r := httprouter.New()
    r.GET(&quot;/&quot;, redirect(&quot;health&quot;))
    r.GET(&quot;/health&quot;, health)
    
    r.POST(&quot;/v1/user&quot;, h.createUser)
    r.GET(&quot;/v1/user&quot;, h.AuthMiddleware(h.readUser))
    r.GET(&quot;/v1/webhook/:webhookID&quot;, h.readWebhook)

    return h
}
</code></pre>
<p>The actual <code>main</code> function of your application then creates a new Handler and passes the required
    dependencies to it.
    In this case it's set up as an HTTP server, but you could switch these out with GRPC for example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// set up the route handler and server
app := handler.New(handler.Dependencies{
    Auth:       auth,
    UserSvc:    userSvc,
    WebhookSvc: webhookSvc,
})
srv := &amp;http.Server{
    Addr:         &quot;:8080&quot;,
    ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
    WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
    Handler:      app,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The route that's responsible for reading webhooks then relies on the webhook service. We know that the webhook
    service
    replies with a <code>Webhook</code> model or an error and handle accordingly. In fact, we know about
    <code>ErrWebhookNotFound</code> and
    can handle that differently, namely with a 404 status code.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (h *Handler) readWebhook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, p httprouter.Params) {
    // we go into our dependency container and get the webhook service
    webhook, err := h.WebhookSvc.Read(r.Context(), p.ByName(&quot;webhookID&quot;))
    switch {
        // note that errors are also considered as domain models
        case errors.Is(err, app.ErrWebhookNotFound):
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusNotFound)
            return
        case err != nil:
            error500(w, err)
            return
    }
    
    // custom output format for webhooks
    type webhookOutput struct {
        URL         string    `json:&quot;url&quot;`
        Triggers    []string  `json:&quot;triggers&quot;`
        TriggeredAt time.Time `json:&quot;triggered_at&quot;`
    }
    
    // apparently our API docs are a bit different from our local domain model
    whResp := webhookOutput{
        URL:         webhook.URL,
        Triggers:    webhook.Events,
        TriggeredAt: webhook.UpdatedAt,
    }
    
    if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(whResp); err != nil {
        error500(w, err)
        return
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>Services are the glue between the layers. They are running the business logic of your application.
    This includes business validation, collecting data from the storage layer, and any kind of generating, collecting or
    filtering.</p>
<p>The file <code>/services/service.go</code> contains the definition of the service interface. This interface is also
    part of
    the dependencies in the handler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type UserService interface {
	Add(ctx context.Context, user *app.User) error
	User(ctx context.Context, userID uuid.UUID) (*app.User, error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the file <code>/services/user.go</code> you can see how the service is implemented. We can't use the name
    <code>UserService</code> because
    that's already taken by the interface. <em>This is also the reason I called the project <code>svc</code>, if I
        remember correctly.</em>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// UserSvc is our service struct that implements the services.UserService interface
type UserSvc struct {
	storage storage.UserStorage
	auth    *Auth
}

func NewUserSvc(userStorage storage.UserStorage, auth *Auth) (*UserSvc, error) {
	return &amp;UserSvc{
		storage: userStorage,
		auth:    auth,
	}, nil
}

// User returns the user based on the user ID
func (u *UserSvc) User(ctx context.Context, userID uuid.UUID) (*app.User, error) {
	return u.storage.Read(ctx, userID)
}

// Add adds a user to our service and repository
func (u *UserSvc) Add(ctx context.Context, user *app.User) error {
	userID := uuid.New()

	token, err := u.auth.Create(userID.String())
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// create user object
	user.ID = userID
	user.Token = token
	n := time.Now().UTC()
	user.CreatedAt = n
	user.UpdatedAt = n

	// persist it
	return u.storage.Create(ctx, user)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="storages">Storages</h3>
<p>Storages handle the persistence of the domain models. Sometimes these can be taken directly from the model,
    sometimes they need to be converted to a storage model, or DAO if you wish.</p>
<p>In the file <code>/storages/storage.go</code> we can again find the interface. Having our storages be interfaces
    allows us
    to easily swap out the storage implementation for testing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type UserStorage interface {
	Create(ctx context.Context, user *app.User) error
	Read(ctx context.Context, userID uuid.UUID) (*app.User, error)
	AllUsers(ctx context.Context) []*app.User
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's good to keep in mind that you're only allowed to communicate with domain models. You can see this in action
    when dealing with MySQL errors, something the service should know nothing about.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (u *UserRepository) Read(ctx context.Context, userID uuid.UUID) (*app.User, error) {
	uid, _ := userID.MarshalBinary()
	row := u.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, &quot;SELECT id, name, token, createdAt, updatedAt FROM users WHERE id = ?&quot;, uid)

	// Rationale: I'm reusing the app.User here because the fields are quite primitive types
	// Depending on your scheme you could easily do some transformations here to change
	// app.User to a customer UserDAO struct, f.e. when your database engine stores bools as tinyints.
	user := new(app.User)
	err := row.Scan(&amp;user.ID, &amp;user.Name, &amp;user.Token, &amp;user.CreatedAt, &amp;user.UpdatedAt)
	switch {
	// Rationale: Our service layer knows nothing about sql.ErrNoRows, but we at this point do
	// that's why it's important to convert your database engine errors to common Domain model errors
	// that are known within the application.
	// This specific example makes use of the %w verb to wrap errors with a custom message
	case err == sql.ErrNoRows:
		return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;user with ID %q not found: %w&quot;, userID, app.ErrUserNotFound)
	// Rationale: Here we're explicitly not wrapping the error as the service shouldn't do anything with it.
	// However, if you started noticing these in your logs, you can probably handle them like the above case.
	case err != nil:
		return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;unknown error while scanning user: %v&quot;, err)
	}

	return user, nil
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>If you want to get separation of concerns and clarity when developing, this is a nice convention to follow.</p>
<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>Your application is divided into layers.</li>
    <li>Layers communicate with other layers, via interfaces, by sending and receiving domain models</li>
    <li>Handlers talk to services, services talk to other services and storages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I introduced this <em>framework</em> successfully at <a href="https://www.kramphub.nl/">Kramp Hub</a>, and it allowed
    the team to easily jump between
    projects and quickly get started. We used GRPC so some interfaces were actually protobuf services, but other
    than that it still worked the same.</p>
<p>I'm also introducing it at <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> with my team right now. This time however
    it's a bit more difficult.
    The team is larger and the project is already quite large; perhaps not even <em>micro</em> anymore.
    I've switched from &quot;layers with packages&quot; to &quot;layers in packages&quot;. This is an ongoing process,
    so I might write a follow-up on that.
