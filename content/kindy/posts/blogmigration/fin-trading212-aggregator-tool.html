<p>As you could see in my <a href="/tags/roi-stock-portfolio">ROI stock series</a>, I've been using Trading212 for a
  while now.</p>
<p>While it has some nice dashboards, I wanted more and since they offer a very nice CSV exporting feature,
  I decided to create my own Go-based tool to do aggregation and create a financial overview of my stocks.</p>
<p><em>💸 You can still use my affiliate link to get your own Trading212 account including a free stock of up to €100:

<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>fin is a Trading212 CSV utility that aggregates your transactional CSV files into a couple of output formats.</p>
<p>You can generate an <code>aggregate</code> formatted JSON file that's used by the reporting tool,
  or you can generate a <code>yahoo</code> formatted CSV file that can be imported into <a
    href="https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolios">Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<p>The tool deals with pies, stock splits and Yahoo ticker symbols. However, it's required by the user
  to maintain these settings in the <code>config.yaml</code> file. After running the tool for the first time
  a default <code>config.yaml</code> file will be generated for you.</p>
<p>⚡ The goal of this tool is to give a big overview of your portfolio, along with fees and costs.
  It combines all transactions and comes up with a final tally, as such it's not meant to help with taxes.</p>

<h2 id="config">Config</h2>
<p>There's quite a few things you can configure, depending on how you want to split your aggregating or reporting.</p>
<p>We support pies (a subset of stocks within your portfolio), splits, renames and more.
  These however need to be configured by the user.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
# Required config
input: data # folder where your Trading212 CSVs are stored
output: aggregated_quotes # name of output file (prefix)
format: aggregate # aggregate or yahoo

# Optional config
skip-pies: true # skip splitting by pies (default: false)
pie-only: &quot;&quot; # only generate this pie (default: &quot;&quot;)

# Splits is a list of split events relevant to your portfolio
# this is needed to calculate the total stock count
splits:
  - symbol: ABEC
    date: 2022-07-16
    ratio: 20 # for reverse splits, use a decimal ratio

# Symbols is a list of conversions to take Trading212 symbols
# and convert them to the symbols used by Yahoo portfolios
symbols:
  RIO: RIO.L
  SAN: SAN.PA

# Renames deal with stocks that have changed their symbol
# for example by becoming a new company or by being delisted
renames:
  GPS: GAP
  TUP: TUPBQ
 
# Pies allows you split your aggregation into multiple CSVs
# uncomment to use
#pies:
#  - name: Growth
#    symbols:
#      - GOOG
#      - AMZN
#  - name: Dividend
#    symbols:
#      - PEP
#      - JNJ

<p>The project has a reporting tool that can be used to generate a report of your portfolio.
  It's also available at <a href="https://fin.gerben.dev">https://fin.gerben.dev</a> as hosted by GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>It uses jQuery, Bootstrap and Bootstrap Table to generate the report. It uses a local file mode with LocalStorage,
  and the resources coming from a CDN. None of the data is stored outside your browser.</p>
<h3 id="aggjson">agg.json</h3>
<p>The data from all your buy, sell or dividend events are aggregated and if you use the <code>aggregate</code>
  output method, it will look like this:</p>

<p>It's free of charge, covers most cases, but is not 100% perfect. There's always issues with float arithmetics.</p>
<p>The tool tries its best to deal with multiple currencies, but because of the fluid nature of foreign exchange rates
  it's all based on best estimate.</p>
